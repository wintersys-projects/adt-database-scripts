# Description : This script will install the application DB for the database type that you have installed.
# It expects a database system to be online either locally or as a managed database at a remote location. 
# Your database dump file is expected to be available either in a repository (if you are installing a baseline) or 
# in your datastore if you are making a temporal backup based deployment. If the database archive is damaged in any
# way then the installation of your application's database will fail. 
# It has rudimentary checking that the application database has installed correctly and it will apply application
# branding to make your application flexible enough to work for differently domain named deployments to that which
# your application was originally built as making it possible for your application to be built by you for your domain
# name but deployed by 3rd parties with a different domain name
